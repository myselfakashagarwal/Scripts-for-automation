# About üë®üèΩ‚Äçüíª
The Git Server is a robust infrastructure designed for hosting Git repositories, utilizing GitLab-CE for self-hosting, Cloudflared tunneling for secure access, and a Cockpit web interface for efficient system administration. Extreme automation is a cornerstone of this infrastructure, facilitated by Bash scripts. These scripts handle tasks ranging from user and group management to server maintenance and operations. The server also holds the "Git-Recipes" repository, which represents real-world Git techniques and depicts them with examples mimicking real-world scenarios.Overall, the Git Server serves its purpose to provide seamless continuous integration and server tasks like automation, security, system administration, scripting, etc.
